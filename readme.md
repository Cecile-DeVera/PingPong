## Description

_This is an Epicodus project brought to you by Epicodus. This project is called Ping Pong with the use of loops and arrays. When the user inputs a number it will list every number until it reaches the user input. However, when there are numbers divisible by 3, it will say "Ping". When there are numbers divisible by 5, it will say "Pong". When there is a number that can be divisible by 3 and 5, it will say "PingPong"._
